# ✅ **COMPLETED** - Start and Finish Stacks

## Original Plan
Currently the pieces that are at start and finish are displayed as a line of pieces in a single div we often refer to as home, with finished pieces to the left and starting pieces to the right

I would like to change this to show starting and finished pieces as 2 stacks of pieces similar to how stacked pieces are displayed on the board.

The starting stack should be on the left and the finished stack on the right.

This change will affect the display and the piece animations for when pieces are moving to or from home.
This change will not affect game play.

## ✅ Implementation Completed

### What Was Implemented:
1. **New PieceStack Component** (`src/components/PieceStack.tsx`)
   - Reusable stack visualization with consistent styling
   - Handles click interactions for eligible pieces
   - Shows piece counts in labels
   - Visual feedback for eligible/selected pieces

2. **Updated PlayerHome Component** (`src/PlayerHome.tsx`)
   - Replaced horizontal grid layout with two vertical stacks
   - Starting stack on the left, finished stack on the right
   - Maintains all existing functionality (piece selection, completion)
   - Consistent visual styling with board stacks

### Visual Changes:
- **Before**: `🏁🏁🏁 | 🔴🔴🔴🔴🔴` (horizontal line)
- **After**: Two vertical stacks side by side with proper stacking offsets

### Technical Details:
- Uses existing `STACK_OFFSET` constant (5px) for consistent stacking
- Preserved all click handlers and game logic
- Added completion destination indicator above finished stack
- Responsive design with flexible gaps between stacks

### Files Modified:
- ✅ `src/components/PieceStack.tsx` - New component
- ✅ `src/PlayerHome.tsx` - Major refactor to use stacks
- ✅ `src/GameLayout.tsx` - Updated `getHomePosition` for stack-top animations

### ✅ Phase 2 Complete: Animation Updates
**Animation system now properly handles stack-based positioning:**

#### Updated Components:
- **`GameLayout.tsx`**: Modified `getHomePosition()` function to:
  - Find stack containers instead of grid layout
  - Calculate top-of-stack positions using `STACK_OFFSET`
  - Handle both starting stack (left) and finished stack (right)
  - Account for current piece counts in each stack

#### Animation Behavior:
- **Pieces leaving start**: Animate from top of starting stack
- **Pieces returning to start**: Animate to top of starting stack  
- **Pieces finishing**: Animate to top of finished stack
- **Captured pieces**: Automatically return to top of starting stack

#### Technical Implementation:
- Uses existing `STACK_OFFSET` constant for consistent positioning
- Calculates dynamic stack heights based on piece counts
- Preserves all existing animation timing and easing
- Compatible with both `PieceAnimator` and `CapturedPieceAnimator`

**All functionality now complete!** ✅
